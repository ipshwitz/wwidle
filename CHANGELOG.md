## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-03 08:10 PM EDT

- Set up project tracking: added `CLAUDE.md` (architecture/decisions reference)
  and this changelog.
- Locked in initial architecture: MVVM + Clean Architecture, Hilt DI, Room for
  local save data, Supabase for auth/cloud sync/leaderboards (anonymous-first
  auth), DataStore for preferences.
- Decided core game design direction: gold generators are themed Creature
  Lairs/Dens (Adventure Capitalist–style), prestige mechanic is "Molt" (reset
  for permanent Scale Shards), art style is vector/flat illustration in Compose,
  monetization is free-to-play with rewarded ads + optional IAP.
- Confirmed all naming going forward uses Dungeons & Dragons theming (no reused
  terminology from other projects).
