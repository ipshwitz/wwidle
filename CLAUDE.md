# CLAUDE.md — Wyrm & Whelp: Idle Hoard

Living reference for building this game with Claude. Update this file whenever a
decision changes — it is the source of truth for architecture and conventions,
not a historical log (that's [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).

## Project overview

- **Name:** Wyrm & Whelp: Idle Hoard
- **Genre:** Idle/incremental clicker (Adventure Capitalist–style), Android, Kotlin
- **Package:** `com.wyrmwhelp.idlehoard`
- **Theme:** Dungeons & Dragons–flavored. All naming (classes, screens, UI copy,
  game entities) uses D&D-appropriate terms — no leftover terminology from other
  projects (e.g. a prior food/kitchen-themed idle game). If a name doesn't fit a
  fantasy hoard/dragon theme, rename it before it lands in the codebase.

## Assets

- **`/assets`** (repo root) holds source game assets — logos, background art,
  and other raw design files. This is separate from Android's own
  `app/src/main/assets` runtime-assets folder (for files bundled into the APK
  and read via `AssetManager`). Files land in `/assets` before being copied
  into `app/src/main/res/drawable-nodpi/` (as-is, no density upscaling — for
  single full-bleed art rather than density-bucketed icon sets) to actually
  use from Compose. In use so far: `main-bg.png` → `drawable-nodpi/main_bg.png`,
  `GameScreen`'s background (behind a 50%-opacity white overlay so the art
  doesn't fight with the lair list for attention); `closed-chest.png` /
  `open-chest.png` → `drawable-nodpi/closed_chest.png` / `open_chest.png`,
  `FloatingMenu`'s FAB art for its collapsed/expanded states — both have real
  transparent backgrounds now (open-chest.png's initial export didn't; it was
  re-exported and re-copied); `menu-help_social.png` / `menu-unlocks.png` /
  `menu-upgrades.png` / `menu-stewards.png` / `menu-level_up.png` →
  `drawable-nodpi/menu_*.png`, the wooden-sign art for those `FloatingMenu`
  items (each image already has its label baked in — no separate text overlay
  needed). Settings has no art yet and still falls back to a plain labeled
  surface. `woodenwall-1.png` → `drawable-nodpi/woodenwall_1.png`, a tavern-
  interior background used by `SectionOverlayCard` (via `AppBackground`,
  which now takes an `imageRes` param instead of always using `main_bg`) —
  no transparency needed for this one, it's an opaque full-bleed backdrop
  like `main_bg.png`, not an icon. **Before copying any new *icon* art (things
  meant to sit on top of other content) into `drawable-nodpi/`, verify it
  actually has a transparent background** (check corner pixel alpha — `file`
  reporting "RGBA" only means an alpha channel exists, not that it's used;
  `open-chest.png`'s first export was RGBA but fully opaque). Full-bleed
  backdrops like `main_bg.png`/`woodenwall_1.png` are the exception — they're
  meant to be opaque.
- **`/SQL`** (repo root) holds every SQL script that needs to be run against
  the Supabase project, sequentially numbered (`001_create_cloud_saves_table.sql`,
  `002_...`) in the order they should be applied. Each is a one-time script run
  manually in the Supabase Dashboard's SQL Editor (no migration tooling wired
  up) — see the file's own header comment for exactly what to run and any
  dashboard-only settings (e.g. toggles) it doesn't cover.

## Workflow rules

These apply to every change made in this repo, however small:

1. **Bump the version every change**, using `A.B.C` (Major.Minor.Patch) semantic
   versioning in [app/build.gradle.kts](app/build.gradle.kts) (`versionName`, and
   increment `versionCode` by 1 each bump):
   - **Patch (A.B.C → A.B.C+1):** bug fixes, tuning, small tweaks, refactors.
   - **Minor (A.B.C → A.(B+1).0):** new features/systems added, backward-compatible.
   - **Major ((A+1).0.0):** breaking save-data changes, ground-up reworks, or the
     jump from pre-release (0.x.x) to first stable release (1.0.0).
   - Current version: **0.7.3** (fixed overlay-card padding/sizing — see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).
2. **Log every change in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**, newest entry on top, in
   plain simplified language (what changed, not a diff dump), with a date and
   time in US Eastern (EST/EDT) for each entry.

## Build environment notes

- **Windows JDK loopback-socket bug (JDK-8305163):** running `gradlew` from a
  shell whose `TEMP`/`TMPDIR` resolves to a long path (as happens under this
  Claude Code session's scratchpad) makes the JVM fail with
  `java.io.IOException: Unable to establish loopback connection` before any
  build task runs — it's a Unix-domain-socket path-length limit, unrelated to
  the project. Fix: point Java at a short temp dir for the invocation, e.g.
  `TMPDIR="D:/gtmp" TEMP="D:\gtmp" TMP="D:\gtmp" JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS="-Djava.io.tmpdir=D:/gtmp" ./gradlew.bat <task>`.
- **compileSdk 36 / AGP 8.13.2 dependency ceiling:** don't bump
  `androidx.core`/`androidx.core-ktx` past 1.17.x or `androidx.lifecycle-*`
  past 2.9.x without also bumping AGP — newer versions require compileSdk 37,
  which needs AGP 9.1.0+. This bit us again with `androidx.navigation:navigation-compose`
  — 2.10.0 pulls in `lifecycle-*:2.11.0` transitively and hits the same
  ceiling; 2.9.4 (paired with lifecycle 2.9.3, matching our pin) works fine.
  Same rule applies to any future AndroidX dependency: check what `lifecycle-*`
  version it pulls in before bumping.
- **Emulator screencap/screenrecord returned a blank frame on this host for
  several sessions**, then started working again unexplained (same Pixel_8
  AVD, `-no-window`, `swiftshader_indirect`) — likely a transient host/driver
  compositor issue rather than anything fixable in-project. Don't assume
  either state: try a real `screencap` first, and if it comes back
  byte-identical to a previous blank capture (or a suspiciously round file
  size), fall back to `adb shell uiautomator dump` (pull with
  `adb pull //sdcard/window_dump.xml <path>`, double leading slash to dodge
  Git Bash path mangling) to verify UI text/state instead.

## Tech stack & architecture

**Pattern:** MVVM + Clean Architecture, DI via Hilt.

- **Presentation (UI):** Jetpack Compose screens/composables. ViewModels expose
  `StateFlow` to the UI. `@HiltViewModel` throughout.
  - `GameViewModel` — implemented (`ui/game/GameViewModel.kt`): wraps
    `GameEngine`, starts its tick loop and settles offline earnings once on
    creation, exposes claim/hire-Steward/plunder actions. `GameScreen`/
    `LairCard`/`WelcomeBackDialog` (`ui/game/`) are the first real screen,
    wired up in `MainActivity` via `by viewModels()`.
  - `LairCard` styling: no Material `Card` — a custom `Box` sized via
    `Modifier.height(IntrinsicSize.Min)` so a second, fractionally-widthed Box
    can render *behind* the text/buttons as a left-to-right fill representing
    `cycleProgressSeconds / baseProductionSeconds` (100% = ready to plunder).
    Both the track and the fill are the same per-tier "rarity" color
    (`rarityColor(tier)`, a 5-band green→blue→purple→orange→gold ramp) at
    different alpha, so the whole card doubles as its own progress bar and
    stays translucent enough to show `GameScreen`'s background art through.
    The fill's target value is wrapped in `animateFloatAsState` (linear
    easing, duration = `GameEngine.TICK_INTERVAL_MS`) — `GameEngine` only
    pushes a new value every tick, which reads as visible steps without this;
    animating linearly across that same window turns it back into continuous
    motion. Keep the two in sync if either changes.
  - `AuthViewModel` — Supabase auth
  - `SettingsViewModel` — user preferences
  - `ConsentViewModel` — privacy/ad consent
  - **No Navigation Compose** — tried it first (type-safe routes,
    `NavController`/`NavHost`), then removed it: every `FloatingMenu` section
    is a card that slides up over the still-mounted game rather than a
    separate screen you navigate to (see `SectionOverlayCard` below), so
    there was nothing left for a nav graph to do with only one real
    destination. Don't re-add it reflexively if a section later needs a
    "real" screen — reconsider whether it should instead just be a bigger
    `SectionOverlayCard` first.
  - **`FloatingMenu`** (`ui/menu/FloatingMenu.kt`) — the app-wide hamburger
    toggle, fixed bottom-center, overlaid *above* `GameScreen` in
    `MainActivity`'s `WyrmWhelpApp`. The toggle is a transparent-background
    `IconButton`, not a Material `FloatingActionButton` — a FAB always draws
    its own solid container/shadow, which showed as a box behind the chest
    art. It shows `closed_chest`/`open_chest` art (swapped based on
    `expanded`) instead of a generic menu glyph. Expands upward into a
    vertical stack of tappable `floatingMenuItems` (a `MenuItem(label,
    imageRes?)` list, `Arrangement.spacedBy(4.dp)` between them) — evoking the
    wooden trail signpost in the background art. An item with `imageRes` set
    renders as that wooden-sign image directly, no extra container (the sign
    art already has its label baked in); Settings (no art yet) falls back to
    a plain labeled `Surface`. Tapping any item collapses the menu and calls
    `onItemSelected(label)`, which `WyrmWhelpApp` uses to open a
    `SectionOverlayCard` — it does not navigate anywhere.
  - **`SectionOverlayCard`** (`ui/common/SectionOverlayCard.kt`) — the
    replacement for a separate "Coming Soon" screen: a card that slides up
    from the bottom to cover 92% of the screen height (rounded top corners,
    scrim behind it, game still visibly mounted/peeking above and dimmed
    underneath), with a close `X` (`IconButton` + `Icons.Default.Close`,
    top-right) plus tap-scrim-to-dismiss and back-button-to-dismiss
    (`BackHandler` in `MainActivity`, only enabled while a section is open).
    Driven by one nullable `openSection: String?` in `WyrmWhelpApp` — non-null
    shows the card with that title. Retains the last non-null title internally
    while animating out so the card doesn't go blank mid-exit. The header
    reuses whichever `floatingMenuItems` entry matches the title (same
    wooden-sign image shown on that item in the menu) and straddles the
    card's top edge like a hanging plaque — the card's own `Surface` is inset
    from the top by half the sign's fixed height (`SIGN_HEADER_HEIGHT / 2`),
    and the sign sits at the very top of the surrounding `Box` (not inside the
    `Surface`), so its top half reads as outside the card over the scrim and
    its bottom half overlaps the card surface. Settings (no art yet) falls
    back to a plain bold title with no overlap/inset. **Content padding inside
    the surface must clear the sign's actual overlap
    (`SIGN_HEADER_HEIGHT / 2`) plus its own breathing room, not a flat
    guessed value** — using less renders content partly hidden underneath the
    sign, which shipped once and was caught from a screenshot. The card's own
    background (inside the `Surface`, i.e. below the sign's overlap point) is
    `AppBackground` with `imageRes = R.drawable.woodenwall_1` — a tavern
    interior, distinct from `GameScreen`'s landscape — behind the same 50%-
    white overlay. Every section currently shows "Coming soon…" below the
    header; give a section real content later by branching on `title` inside
    it (or splitting it out) rather than reintroducing routes.
  - **`AppBackground`** (`ui/common/AppBackground.kt`) — the shared
    background-art-plus-50%-white-overlay treatment, parameterized by
    `imageRes` (defaults to `main_bg`, `GameScreen`'s landscape). Also used by
    `SectionOverlayCard` with `woodenwall_1` — keep it parameterized rather
    than hardcoding a single image if a third surface needs this treatment.
- **Domain:** `GameEngine` — core tick loop, income calculation, offline-earnings
  math. `@Singleton` via Hilt.
- **Data:**
  - **Room** — local persistence, implemented (`data/local/`): `GameStateEntity`
    (single-row table for currencies/meta) + `OwnedLairEntity` (one row per
    claimed lair), `GameStateDao`, `WyrmWhelpDatabase`. `RoomGameRepository`
    implements the domain-layer `GameRepository` interface
    (`domain/repository/GameRepository.kt`) — `GameViewModel` loads the save
    on creation (before applying offline earnings/starting the tick loop) and
    autosaves every 30s. Upgrades/milestones tables don't exist yet (those
    systems aren't built).
  - **Supabase** — auth + cloud saves implemented (`data/remote/`):
    `SupabaseAuthRepository` (anonymous sign-in, implements domain
    `AuthRepository`) and `SupabaseCloudSaveRepository` (upload/download the
    `cloud_saves` row as jsonb via `GameStateDto`, implements domain
    `CloudSaveRepository`). `SupabaseModule` (`di/`) provides the
    `SupabaseClient` (Auth + Postgrest plugins) from `BuildConfig.SUPABASE_URL`
    / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, which are read from `local.properties` (gitignored —
    see below). Merge-on-launch logic lives in `domain/model/GameStateExtensions.kt`
    (`mergeGameStates`, `estimatedNetWorth`). Leaderboard not started.
  - **DataStore** — user preferences, consent state, ad-watch tracking
  - Repositories wrap each data source; ViewModels never touch Room/Supabase directly.
- **DI bindings:** `@Singleton` for `GameEngine`, `AdManager`, `ConsentManager`;
  `@HiltViewModel` for all ViewModels; `@ApplicationContext` injected where needed;
  `@Inject constructor` throughout.

### Save data & cloud sync

- **Local:** Room. `GameEngine` autosaves every 30s (toggleable in Settings —
  Settings screen not built yet, so not actually toggleable in-app).
- **Cloud:** Supabase `cloud_saves` table, entire game state as one `jsonb` blob
  (not normalized relational tables — simplest for idle-game state + offline math).
  Table/RLS policies defined in `SQL/001_create_cloud_saves_table.sql`.
- **Sync triggers — implemented:** once per app launch, right after anonymous
  sign-in resolves (`GameViewModel` init). **Not yet implemented:** manual "Save
  to Cloud" button in Settings, on-Level-Up sync, any periodic/backgrounding
  push — none of those exist yet (no Settings screen, no Level Up). See open
  questions.
- **Merge logic:** `domain/model/GameStateExtensions.kt#mergeGameStates` —
  compares local vs. cloud `GameState`, higher `totalMolts` (Level Up count)
  wins outright,
  `estimatedNetWorth()` (liquid currency + what owned lairs cost to claim from
  scratch) breaks ties within the same prestige count. The winner is loaded
  into `GameEngine`, then re-saved to both Room and Supabase after offline
  earnings settle.
- **Offline earnings:** `GameState.lastSavedAt` (whichever save — local or
  cloud — won the merge) feeds `GameEngine.applyOfflineEarnings()`, capped by
  `offlineCapHours` (default 4h, upgradeable via game progression, not
  implemented yet).
- **Resilience:** every network step (sign-in, download, upload) in
  `GameViewModel` is wrapped individually so a failure degrades to local-only
  play instead of blocking or crashing — see `Log.w(TAG, ...)` call sites.
- **Guest mode:** doesn't really exist as a separate mode anymore — anonymous
  auth means every install gets cloud sync from the first launch (falling back
  to local-only only if the network/Supabase call actually fails).

### Auth

Supabase anonymous auth first — players start instantly with cloud sync/leaderboard
eligibility from the first session. They can later link email/Google to carry
progress across devices and reinstalls without losing anonymous-session progress
(linking not implemented yet — currently every install/reinstall is a brand new
anonymous identity with no way to recover a previous one).

**Project config:** `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` live in `local.properties`
(gitignored, not committed) and are exposed to the app via `BuildConfig` fields
(`app/build.gradle.kts` reads `local.properties` at build time). A fresh clone
needs these two lines added to its own `local.properties` before cloud sync will
work — ask whoever has the Supabase project for the values, or create a new
Supabase project and run the scripts in `/SQL` against it.

### Monetization

Free-to-play: rewarded ads (boosts, offline-earnings multipliers) + optional IAP
(gems, time-skips, cosmetics). No forced interstitials.

## Core game design

- **Generators — Creature Lairs/Dens:** direct analog to Adventure Capitalist's
  businesses. Each lair is a themed monster den, using real D&D 5E SRD
  creatures/Challenge Ratings for flavor and tuning anchor, from Kobold Warren
  (CR 1/8) up through the Ancient Dragon's Hoard (CR 24) — see
  `domain/catalog/CreatureLairCatalog.kt` for the full 14-tier list and
  `domain/model/CreatureLair.kt` / `OwnedLair.kt` / `GameState.kt` for the data
  model. `domain/engine/GameEngine.kt` is the app-scoped singleton tick loop:
  each lair produces gold on a cycle timer; without a hired Steward, a
  finished cycle sits full and waits for the player to tap it ("plunder") —
  it never silently completes a second cycle underneath them. A Steward
  auto-collects every completed cycle, online or offline. Whelps/Wyrms are a
  separate collectible/pet system layered on top of the lair economy (details
  TBD as we build it out — not yet started).
- **Balance:** tiers 0–9 (Kobold Warren through Troll Warren) use AdVenture
  Capitalist's real Earth Business numbers 1:1 (gold pieces standing in for
  dollars) — see `CreatureLairCatalog`'s class doc for exactly which AdCap
  business maps to which lair and how tiers 10–13 (D&D has no Earth
  equivalent past Oil Company) extend the same cost/income patterns with a
  tempered cycle-time curve. A new save starts owning one Kobold Warren
  already (matching AdCap's free starting Lemonade Stand) with 0 gold.
- **Prestige — Level Up** (renamed from "Molt"): resets the current
  hoard/lairs in exchange for **Scale Shards**, a permanent-bonus currency
  that boosts all future runs. Renamed because "Molt" only fit dragon-flavored
  lairs, not the goblins/orcs/etc. earlier in the catalog — "Level Up" is
  generic TTRPG language that fits every tier. Mechanic still not implemented
  (see open questions); the persisted field is still named
  `GameState.totalMolts` internally — rename it to match once Level Up is
  actually built, so the old name doesn't linger as a mismatch.
- **Art style:** vector/flat illustration, built with Compose (custom vector
  drawables + Compose Canvas for animation). No external sprite/asset-pack
  dependency.

Currency names, lair tiers/costs, whelp/wyrm collectible mechanics, leaderboard
scope, and exact number-formatting (large-number suffixes) are still open —
we'll pin these down as we build each system.

## Open questions / not yet decided

- Whelp/Wyrm collectible system mechanics (how it interacts with lairs)
- Full currency list (gold + premium currency name, any specialty currencies) —
  Gold Pieces and Platinum Pieces are wired into `GameState`, but Platinum has
  no spend sink yet (IAP/shop not built)
- Large-number formatting convention — first-pass answer landed in
  `ui/format/GoldFormat.kt` (K/M/B/T/Qa/... suffixes); `GameState.goldPieces`
  is still a raw `Double` underneath, which will need revisiting once the
  economy grows past what a `Double` represents precisely
- Lair cost/income/timing for tiers 0–9 is sourced directly from AdVenture
  Capitalist's Earth Businesses (see `CreatureLairCatalog`); tiers 10–13 are
  our own extrapolation of the same patterns, still not playtested
- Upgrade system (AdCap-style income multipliers per lair at ownership
  milestones) — not implemented; each lair's income currently scales linearly
  with units owned only
- Leaderboard scope (global hoard value? fastest Level Up? per-lair records?)
- Target device scope (phone-only vs. tablet/landscape support)
- Cloud sync only happens once per app launch (right after anonymous sign-in);
  no manual button, Level Up trigger, or backgrounding push yet — a long
  session with no restart won't push its progress to the cloud until it's
  closed and reopened. Add more triggers once Settings/Level Up exist.
- Anonymous identity isn't recoverable — no email/Google linking yet, so a
  reinstall or a cleared app means a brand new (empty) cloud identity, not a
  restored one.
